# Dynamic Team Page

Design a bio page! Consider this a page in the context of a larger studio site - look at how “real”
design / dev houses do this, and come up with your own style.

# Additional Requirement
1. Include a written plan / path with your submission. Analyze the requirements
and provide the solution
2. The developer will create a project repo and a README.md document for the repo with
detailed information about the project
3. Create a design branch; the designer will push the web assets to this branch. The
designer is responsible for the HTML and CSS for the project
4. Create a dev branch for each member; BOTH need to add bio information to the array
5. Merge everything to the main branch and submit a link to the dropbox on FOL - a .txt
file is fine.
